# makefile-after : pattern rules for WorkingWiki operations.
#
# If your project says to make Y from X, you don't have to
# provide a makefile for that operation if it's covered by
# the rules in here.
#
# This makefile provides pattern rules only, so it shouldn't conflict with
# any rules you write for specific files.  It's read after the project's
# makefile(s), so a project can define pattern rules that pre-empt the ones
# here.
#
# see also makefile-before.

#                 is a valid URL that will display project file XX

# do, then if someone's project contains both figure.eps and figure.pdf,
# and they update the eps, then it will recreate the figure.pdf from the .eps
# the next time the pdflatex rule runs.  This might destroy someone's data.
# So people will have to make their own pdfs or put this rule in their
