Dear Peter and Graham,

All reviewers are now happy with the manuscript, and so am I. It's great that
you found the remaining error in the formula. You can incorporate the comment
from Reviewer 1 when you submit the final version. Congrats on this nice piece
of work.

Philipp

Comments to the Authors:
Please note here if the review is uploaded as an attachment.

Reviewer #1: I am glad the authors found the problem in their argument. I think
the paper could still benefit from additional simplifications, for example
saying clearly that the distance beyond which mutation becomes more probable
than migration scales as

R^* ~ - l \log (C w\mu/s_m)

where C captures some subleading corrections (including the A/A' area dependence)

Reviewer #2: Looks good to me! I'd like to apologize to the authors for not
doing a better job reviewing. I should have focused solely on the main factual
issues (like the factor of area), and not distracted myself and them with so
much about presentation.
