\section{Size of inflorescences}

Let the local rate of growth at location $x$ and time $t$ be given by $f(x,t)$,
and for each $x$ and $t$ let $(X^{(x,t)}_{s})_{s \ge t}$ have the distribution of a branching process begun at $x$ and time $t$,
and let $\mu^{(x,t)}_s(dz) = \P\{ |X^{(x,t)}_s| \in dz \}$  be the marginal distribution of the size of $X^{(x,t)}$.
For a given mutation rate $\mu$ and population density $\rho(dx)$ we have a Poisson process of inflorescences of rate $\mu$,
each of which having distribution $\mu$.  
Then the set of inflorescences still alive at time $t$ is Poisson, 
and the mean measure of such inflorescences that began at location $x$ is
\[ \nu_x(A) = \int_{-\infty}^t \P\{ X^{(x,s)}_t \in A \} ds .\]
The first thing we'd want to do is to ignore the spatial extent of $X$ and only look at the total number of individuals,
so we need to know
\[ \int_{-\infty}^t \mu^{(x,s)}_t(dz) ds . \]

Now assume everything is homogeneous, and let $Z_t$ be a continuous-time branching process begun at zero 
and having generator
\[ Lg(z) .\]
Suppose that $Z$ has total lifetime $\tau$ and that $\tau$ is finite almost surely.
If we treat each inflorescence as a point mass, then the set of (location, mass) coordinates $(x,z)$
are Poisson with intensity $dx \otimes q(z) dz$ where
\[  
  q(z) = \E \left[ \int_0^\tau \one(Z_t = z) dt \right] .
\]
We will be interested in the probability that the offspring of any of the initial (assumed to be small) number of individuals in an inflorescence survive,
which is $1 - \widetilde q(1-p_s)$, where $p_s$ is the probability of survival (so $p_s \approx 2s/\sigma^2$) and
\[
  \widetilde q(u) = \sum_z q(z) u^z .
\]
