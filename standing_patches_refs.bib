  abstract = {A method is developed for calculating the probability of establishment of an allele which is favoured in some places, but not others, in a large subdivided population. This method is quite general, and could be used to calculate the chance that any system which is linear near an absorbing boundary will move away from that boundary. The results are applied to a population distributed along one dimension. Only mutants which arise within a distance $x \approx \sigma / \sqrt{2s}$ of the region in which they are favoured stand an appreciable chance of establishment. The net chance of establishment of mutations distributed randomly across the habitat will be decreased by gene flow if selection against them is sufficiently strong. However, if the mutations are only weakly deleterious outside some limited region, gene flow may increase the net chance of establishment.}

  abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of hybrid zones which are maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. In the first section it is shown that a hybrid zone involving a single locus can move in response to a selective imbalance between the two homozygotes, and also to variation in population density and dispersal rate. It can be trapped by natural barriers, and so an allele which is selected against when rare cannot advance, even if it is advantageous when common. The continuous model used in deriving these results is shown to be a good approximation to the stepping-stone model, provided that the cline contains several demes.
The effect of stochastic forces on multi-locus hybrid zones is then considered. An expression giving the shift in position after an arbitrary perturbation in gamete frequency is derived. Using this formula, it is found that sampling drift is negligible unless the zone includes few organisms and involves few loci. Random variations in population structure are the dominant force, and could allow considerable movement in an even environment. However, natural barriers can still trap hybrid zones, and so it is likely that they will remain roughly where they first formed.}

In particular, we calculate probabilities of fixation for previously deleterious alleles, ignoring the input of new mutations. We find that "Haldane's sieve"--the bias against the establishment of recessive beneficial mutations--does not hold under these conditions. Instead probabilities of fixation are generally independent of dominance. We show that this result is robust to patterns of sex expression for both X-linked and autosomal loci. We further show that adaptive evolution is invariably slower at X-linked than autosomal loci when evolution begins from mutation-selection balance. This result differs from that obtained when adaptation uses new mutations, a finding that may have some bearing on recent attempts to distinguish between hitchhiking and background selection by contrasting the molecular population genetics of X-linked vs. autosomal loci. Last, we suggest a test to determine whether adaptation used new mutations or previously deleterious alleles from the standing genetic variation.}

In the classical model that is used, a favored allele derives from a single mutational origin. This ignores the fact that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently by mutation during the selective phase. In this study, we present a combination of analytical and simulation results to demonstrate the effect of adaptation from recurrent mutation on summary statistics for polymorphism data from a linked neutral locus. We also analyze the power of standard neutrality tests based on the frequency spectrum or on linkage disequilibrium (LD) under this scenario. For recurrent beneficial mutation at biologically realistic rates, we find substantial deviations from the classical pattern of a selective sweep from a single new mutation. Deviations from neutrality in the level of polymorphism and in the frequency spectrum are much less pronounced than in the classical sweep pattern. In contrast, for levels of LD, the signature is even stronger if recurrent beneficial mutation plays a role. We suggest a variant of existing LD tests that increases their power to detect this signature.}

It may adapt either through new beneficial mutations that subsequently sweep through the population or by using alleles from the standing genetic variation. We use diffusion theory to calculate the probabilities for selective adaptations and find a large increase in the fixation probability for weak substitutions, if alleles originate from the standing genetic variation. We then determine the parameter regions where each scenario-standing variation vs. new mutations-is more likely. Adaptations from the standing genetic variation are favored if either the selective advantage is weak or the selection coefficient and the mutation rate are both high. Finally, we analyze the probability of "soft sweeps," where multiple copies of the selected allele contribute to a substitution, and discuss the consequences for the footprint of selection on linked neutral variation. We find that soft sweeps with weaker selective footprints are likely under both scenarios if the mutation rate and/or the selection coefficient is high.}

This ignores that beneficial alleles can enter a population recurrently, either by mutation or migration, during the selective phase. In this case, descendents of several of these independent origins may contribute to the fixation. As a consequence, all ancestral haplotypes that are linked to any of these copies will be retained in the population, affecting the pattern of a selective sweep on linked neutral variation. In this study, we use analytical calculations based on coalescent theory and computer simulations to analyze molecular adaptation from recurrent mutation or migration. Under the assumption of complete linkage, we derive a robust analytical approximation for the number of ancestral haplotypes and their distribution in a sample from the population.

The population cannot respond to changes in environmental conditions which occur over a distance less than the characteristic length. The result does not depend either on the pattern of variation in selective pressures or on the exact shape of the dispersal function.

  abstract = {In general, individuals who survive to reproduce have genotypes that work relatively well under local conditions. Migrating or dispersing offspring elsewhere is likely to decrease an individual's or its offspring's fitness, not to mention the intrinsic costs and risks of dispersal. Gene flow into a population can counteract gene frequency changes because of selection, imposing a limit on local adaptation. In addition, the migrant flow tends to be higher from densely populated to sparsely populated areas. Thus, although the potential for adaptation might be greatest in poor and sparsely populated environments, gene flow will counteract selection more strongly in such populations. Recent papers, both theoretical and empirical, have clarified the important role of migration in evolution, affecting spatial patterns, species ranges and adaptation to the environment; in particular, by emphasizing the crucial interaction between evolutionary and demographic processes.}

We surveyed the protein target for cardenolides, the alpha subunit of the sodium pump, Na+,K+-ATPase (ATPα), in 14 species that feed on cardenolide-producing plants and 15 outgroups spanning three insect orders. Despite the large number of potential targets for modulating cardenolide sensitivity, amino acid substitutions associated with host-plant specialization are highly clustered, with many parallel substitutions. Additionally, we document four independent duplications of ATPα with convergent tissue-specific expression patterns. We find that unique substitutions are disproportionately associated with recent duplications relative to parallel substitutions. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that adaptation tends to take evolutionary paths that minimize negative pleiotropy.},

@article{ralph2010parallel,
  abstract = {Models for detecting the effect of adaptation on population genomic diversity are often predicated on a single newly arisen mutation sweeping rapidly to fixation. However, a population can also adapt to a new environment by multiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel, at the same locus or different loci. These mutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single one from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally, leading to a "soft" sweep in the population. Here we study various models of parallel mutation in a continuous, geographically spread population adapting to a global selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele due to limited dispersal can allow other selected alleles to arise and start to spread elsewhere in the species range. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow dramatically and so initially form a geographic patchwork, a random tessellation, which could be mistaken for a signal of local adaptation. This spatial tessellation will dissipate over time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within the global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed by mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of crystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel mutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs are captured by a single compound parameter, a characteristic length, which reflects the expected distance a spreading allele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This characteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter, the effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the strength of selection. While our knowledge of these parameters is poor, we argue that even in widely dispersing species, such parallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict that as more data become available, many more examples of intraspecies parallel adaptation will be uncovered.

  abstract = {A powerful way to map functional genomic variation and reveal the genetic basis of local adaptation is to associate allele frequency across the genome with environmental conditions. Serpentine soils, characterized by high heavy-metal content and low calcium-to-magnesium ratios, are a classic context for studying adaptation of plants to local soil conditions. To investigate whether Arabidopsis lyrata is locally adapted to serpentine soil, and to map the polymorphisms responsible for such adaptation, we pooled DNA from individuals from serpentine and nonserpentine soils and sequenced each 'gene pool' with the Illumina Genome Analyzer. The polymorphisms that are most strongly associated with soil type are enriched at heavy-metal detoxification and calcium and magnesium transport loci, providing numerous candidate mutations for serpentine adaptation. Sequencing of three candidate loci in the European subspecies of A. lyrata indicates parallel differentiation of the same polymorphism at one locus, confirming ecological adaptation, and different polymorphisms at two other loci, which may indicate convergent evolution.},

  title = {Different genes underlie adaptive melanism in different populations of rock pocket mice},
  abstract = {Identifying the genes responsible for adaptation has been an elusive goal in evolutionary biology. Rock pocket mice (Chaetodipus intermedius) provide a useful system for studying the genetics of adaptation: most C. intermedius are light-coloured and live on light-coloured rocks, but in several different geographical regions, C. intermedius are melanic and live on dark-coloured basalt lava, presumably as an adaptation for crypsis. Previous work demonstrated that mutations at the melanocortin-1 receptor gene (Mc1r) are responsible for the dark/light difference in mice from one population in Arizona. Here, we investigate whether melanism has evolved independently in populations of dark C. intermedius from New Mexico, and whether the same or different genes underlie the dark phenotype in mice from these populations compared with the dark mice from Arizona. Seventy-six mice were collected from pairs of dark and light localities representing four different lava flows and adjacent light-coloured rocks; lava flows were separated by 70-750 km. Spectrophotometric analysis of mouse pelage and of rock samples revealed a strong positive association between coat colour and substrate colour. No significant differences were observed in the colour of rocks among the four lava flows, suggesting that mice in these separate populations have experienced similar selection for crypsis. Despite this similarity in environment, melanic mice from the three New Mexico populations were slightly, but significantly, darker than melanic mice from Arizona. The entire Mc1r gene was sequenced in all mice. The previously identified mutations responsible for the light/dark difference in mice from Arizona were absent in all melanic mice from three different populations in New Mexico. Five new Mc1r polymorphisms were observed among mice from New Mexico, but none showed any association with coat colour. These results indicate that adaptive melanism has arisen at least twice in C. intermedius and that these similar phenotypic changes have a different genetic basis.},

  abstract = {Convergent evolution is a widespread phenomenon seen in diverse organisms inhabiting similar selective environments. However, it is unclear if similar phenotypes are produced by the same or different genes and mutations. Here we analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying convergent pigment pattern among subspecies of the beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus) inhabiting the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of Florida. In these two geographic regions, separated by more than 300 km, "beach mice" have lighter colored coats than do their mainland counterparts, produced by natural selection for camouflage against the pale coastal sand dunes. We measured color pattern in eight beach mouse subspecies and showed that three of the Gulf Coast subspecies are more phenotypically similar to an Atlantic coast subspecies than to their Gulf Coast neighbors. However, light-colored beach mice do not form a monophyletic group. Previous results implicated a single derived amino acid change in the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r) as a major contributor to pigment pattern in the Gulf Coast beach mice; despite phenotypic similarities, the derived Mc1r allele was not found in the Atlantic coast beach mouse populations. Here we show that Atlantic coast beach mice have high levels of Mc1r polymorphism but they lack unique alleles. Functional assays revealed that single amino acid mutations segregating in Atlantic coast beach mice do not cause any change in Mc1r activity compared with the activity of Mc1r from dark-colored mice. These joint results show that convergent pigment patterns in recently diverged beach mouse subspecies--whose developmental constraints are presumably similar--have evolved through a diversity of genetic mechanisms.

@article{kingsley2009melanism,
  abstract = {Identifying the molecular basis of phenotypes that have evolved independently can provide insight into the ways genetic and developmental constraints influence the maintenance of phenotypic diversity. Melanic (darkly pigmented) phenotypes in mammals provide a potent system in which to study the genetic basis of naturally occurring mutant phenotypes because melanism occurs in many mammals, and the mammalian pigmentation pathway is well understood. Spontaneous alleles of a few key pigmentation loci are known to cause melanism in domestic or laboratory populations of mammals, but in natural populations, mutations at one gene, the melanocortin-1 receptor (Mc1r), have been implicated in the vast majority of cases, possibly due to its minimal pleiotropic effects. To investigate whether mutations in this or other genes cause melanism in the wild, we investigated the genetic basis of melanism in the rodent genus Peromyscus, in which melanic mice have been reported in several populations. We focused on two genes known to cause melanism in other taxa, Mc1r and its antagonist, the agouti signaling protein (Agouti). While variation in the Mc1r coding region does not correlate with melanism in any population, in a New Hampshire population, we find that a 125-kb deletion, which includes the upstream regulatory region and exons 1 and 2 of Agouti, results in a loss of Agouti expression and is perfectly associated with melanic color. In a second population from Alaska, we find that a premature stop codon in exon 3 of Agouti is associated with a similar melanic phenotype. These results show that melanism has evolved independently in these populations through mutations in the same gene, and suggest that melanism produced by mutations in genes other than Mc1r may be more common than previously thought.},

@article{pollak1966survival,
  abstract = {A classical problem in population genetics consists in finding the probability that a line descending from a particular gene $A$ will become extinct. A simple assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 42 (1922), 321--341; J. B. S. Haldane, Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 23 (1927), 838--844] is that of a large population where, initially, the number of $A$-genes is small. Another assumption [R. A. Fisher, Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh 50 (1930), 204--219; S. Wright, Genetics 16 (1931), 97--159] is that of a population with a constant number $N$ of genes where $A$ has a certain selective disadvantage over another gene $\overline A$.

The present author considers $K$ subpopulations which inhabit $K$ different ecological niches with possible migration between the niches. First, it is assumed that there is no limit to the size a population can attain and that the $A$-genes reproduce independently of each other. Let $\pi_i\ (i=1,2,\cdots,K)$ be the conditional probability that the line descending from an $A$-gene becomes extinct if the ancestral gene of the line is in niche $i$; the probability that $A$ survives is then expressible in terms of the $\pi_i$. Next, we assume that the population possesses a large but finite number $N_i$ of genes ($A$ or $\overline A$) in niche $i$. If certain assumptions of independence are made, then the probability that $A$ survives is approximated by a function of the above $\pi_i$, provided these are not all equal to unity. },

  abstract = {The population-genetic consequences of population structure are of great interest and have been studied extensively. An area of particular interest is the interaction among population structure, natural selection, and genetic drift. At first glance, different results in this area give very different impressions of the effect of population subdivision on effective population size (N(e)), suggesting that no single value of N(e) can completely characterize a structured population. Results presented here show that a population conforming to Wright's island model of subdivision with genic selection can be related to an idealized panmictic population (a Wright-Fisher population). This equivalent panmictic population has a larger size than the actual population; i.e., N(e) is larger than the actual population size, as expected from many results for this type of population structure. The selection coefficient in the equivalent panmictic population, referred to here as the effective selection coefficient (s(e)), is smaller than the actual selection coefficient (s). This explains how the fixation probability of a selected allele can be unaffected by population subdivision despite the fact that subdivision increases N(e), for the product N(e)s(e) is not altered by subdivision.},

  abstract = {The number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes can be affected by ancestral selectively favored substitutions at linked loci. The degree to which this happens depends on when in the history of the sample the selected substitutions happen, the strength of selection and the amount of crossing over between the sampled locus and the loci at which the selected substitutions occur. This phenomenon is commonly called hitchhiking. Using the coalescent process for a random sample of genes from a selectively neutral locus that is linked to a locus at which selection is taking place, a stochastic, finite population model is developed that describes the steady state effect of hitchhiking on the distribution of the number of selectively neutral polymorphic sites in a random sample. A prediction of the model is that, in regions of low crossing over, strongly selected substitutions in the history of the sample can substantially reduce the number of polymorphic sites in a random sample of genes from that expected under a neutral model.},

  abstract = {A very general partial differential equation in space and time satisfied by the gene frequency in a monoecious population distributed continuously over an arbitrary habitat is derived. The treatment is restricted to a single diallelic locus in the absence of mutation and random drift, and it is supposed that time is continuous, births and deaths occur at random, and migration is independent of genotype. With the further assumptions that migration is isotropic and homogeneous, the population density is constant and uniform (as permitted by the population regulation mechanism included in the formulation), and Hardy-Weinberg proportions obtain locally, this partial differential equation reduces to the simplest multidimensional generalization of the classical Fisher-Haldane cline model. The efficacy of migration and selection in maintaining genetic variability at equilibrium in this model is investigated by deducing conditions for the existence of clines under various circumstances. The effects of the degree of dominance, a neutral belt between the regions where a particular allele is advantageous and deleterious, finiteness of the habitat, and habitat dimensionality are evaluated. Provided at least one of the alleles is favored only in a finite region, excluding the special case in which its total effective selective coefficient is zero, if conditions for supporting a cline are too unfavorable because migration is too strong, selection is too weak, or both, a cline cannot exist at all. Thus, unless there is overdominance, the population must be monomorphic. It is possible for a cline which can barely exist under the prevailing ecological circumstances to show a large amount of variation in gene frequency},

The frequency of mutation is generally small, but it seems probable that it can sometimes be increased by changes in the environment (1,2). On the whole mutants recessive to the normal type occur more commonly than dominants. The frequency of a given type of mutation varies, but for some factors in Drosophila it must be less than 10−6, and is much less in some human cases. We shall first consider initial conditions, when only a few of the new type exist as the result of a single mutation; and then the course of events in a population where the new factor is present in such numbers as to be in no danger of extinction by mere bad luck.

If we suppose then that a utation has occurred, and an entirely new gene is present in a single individual of population consisting of some thousands of millions, the hitsory of its survival may be broadly divided into two periods.  In the first preiod its survival or extinction is due mainly to chance; in the second perios mainly to the general advantage or disadvantage in the struggle for existence which the new allelomorph confers, on the average and in combination with the existing currency of genetic types, as compared with the alternative allelomorph which it displaces.

  abstract = {MR: Consider a Markov branching particle system in $\bold R^d$Rd. Let $\Phi$Φ denote the random genealogical tree generated up to time $t$t, and $Z_t$Zt the random population at time $t$t. The object of interest in this paper is the conditional distribution of $\Phi$Φ given that $Z_t$Zt populates a given site. More precisely, denoting by $P$P the distribution of $\Phi$Φ, the aim is to compute the disintegration of the joint measure $P(d\Phi)Z_t(dy)$P(dΦ)Zt(dy) with respect to its second marginal (assuming that $Z_t$Zt a.s. has no multiple points). The problem is solved in two different ways. One uses "tree methods'' developed by Neveu and Chauvin. The other uses Kallenberg's backward technique. Both methods require growing "Palm trees'' for the individual occupying a given site. These "Palm trees'' are Palm-type distributions on the genealogical trees. The results are obtained first under the assumption of spatially homogeneous branching, and then extended to the inhomogeneous case. },

@incollection{aldous1985exchangeability,
  abstract = {In some broad sense, exchangeability theory may be regarded as the study of probability distributions on a measurable space $S$ which exhibit some symmetry property, such as invariance under a class of transformations of $S$ (though stationarity forms a subject on its own and is usually not included). The core result is the celebrated theorem of de Finetti, which characterizes infinite exchangeable sequences of random variables (i.e., those for which the distribution is invariant under permutations of the components) as mixtures of i.i.d. sequences. For decades after its discovery in the 1930s, this was essentially the only nontrivial result known in the area (with some notable exceptions). A revival of exchangeability theory occurred in the 1970s, with impetus from both theory and applications, and the field has ever since been in a state of vigorous development.

The present lecture notes form the first modern and comprehensive survey of the area. The author, himself a contributor of some remarkable and deep results in the field, has succeeded in filling every page of his treatise with a stunning insight and richness in ideas, which should make the reading of these notes enjoyable and rewarding for every probabilist, especially since some of the more lengthy and technical proofs have been omitted, and attention is focused instead on principles and basic ideas.

The notes are divided into 21 sections, grouped into four parts. Here Part I gives a modern exposition of de Finetti's theorem,\break in different versions and with different proofs. Part II starts with\break Ryll-Nardzewski's subsequence characterization of exchangeable\break sequences and the reviewer's stopping time approach, which leads naturally to a discussion of the author's subsequence principle. This part also contains a brief analysis of exchangeable processes in continuous time, and it ends with a discussion of exchangeable partitions, in the spirit of \n J. F. C. Kingman\en.

In Part III, the author proceeds to some more complicated structures, involving infinitary trees, random arrays, and infinite-dimen-\break sional cubes. The central fact for arrays is the characterization of row-column exchangeability, due independently to the author and \n D. N. Hoover\en. The material on trees and cubes is new, and exhibits some interesting connections to Markov random fields and random walks.

The final part, Part IV, includes miscellaneous topics related to exchangeability, such as random partitions of a line segment, sufficient statistics, sampling from a finite population, and some weak convergence results. There is also a brief account of Kingman's applications of exchangeability to population genetics. One might finally mention the numerous open problems, scattered throughout the notes, which may stimulate a continued rapid growth of the subject. },

An application is made to length biased sampling of excursions of a Markov process away from a recurrent point of its statespace, with emphasis on the Brownian and Bessel cases when the associated inverse local time is a stable subordinator.
